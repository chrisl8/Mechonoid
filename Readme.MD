# Robot Anything

## Work in Progress

This really isn't ready for public consumption yet.

## Raspberry Pi Setup

This is intended to run on a Raspberry Pi running **Ubuntu**. 

Put a fresh copy of Ubuntu 18.04 LTS on your robot's Raspberry Pi then run the installation script below.

## Install
There is a script to install everything. Run:

```
bash <(wget -qO- --no-cache -o /dev/null https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chrisl8/RobotAnything/original/setup.sh)
```

Be sure to read the instructions that the script will print at the end about editing the config files in `~/.RobotAnything/`

**A reboot will be required after the first install.**

To update your code run the same script again, and it will pull down and compile anything new without erasing custom settings.
